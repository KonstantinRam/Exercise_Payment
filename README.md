My very first COBOL program. ^_^

# Task 1: Payment Calculator

Reads employee name and hours worked from keyboard
Calculates pay (hours * rate, with overtime >40 hours at 1.5x)
Shows formatted output with dollar signs and proper alignment
Processes multiple employees until user enters "QUIT"

###Expected output:
```
Enter employee name (or QUIT): John Smith
Enter hours worked: 45
Employee: John Smith          
Regular:  40.0 hrs @ $25.00 = $1,000.00
Overtime:  5.0 hrs @ $37.50 = $  187.50
Total Pay:                    $1,187.50

Enter employee name (or QUIT): QUIT
```
